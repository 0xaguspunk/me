<a id="welcome-to-my-page" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-my-page" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my page!</h3>

<p>Here you can find all the information related to me some of my projects! :) At least all of them that are right now public! Hope you find what you need! If you have any questions don't doubt e-mailing me at <a href="mailto:armellini13@gmail.com">armellini13@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<a id="who-am-i" class="anchor" href="#who-am-i" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who am I</h2>

<p>Hey there! My name is Agust√≠n Armellini Fischer and I was born in Montevideo, Uruguay on Friday the 13th, July 1993. I
moved to Barcelona when I was one year old so I do not remember much about that, but that doesn't mean I do not appreciate their fantastic meat :p. </p>

<p>My mom will say I am computer scientist (or at least I'll be in a couple of months), but what I really am is someone who wants to make this world a better place to live, which is funny because a lot of computer scientist do that (finally it seems I've chosen the right path!).</p>

<p>I love experimenting with anything that comes new. I like to play with any new language, framework and tool that can help me build things that most people will not find useful but I find cool (you can check my projects and judge for yourself). </p>

<p>My two passions other than coding are music and sailing, and the best moments are when I can combine both of them! I play the guitar in a band called Berlin and I sail every time I can.</p>

<p>An Ionic app built with ES6 and Hexagonal Architecture. The aim of this project is to show how you can build an Ionic application with ES6 and Hexagonal Architecture. The code is a simple Ionic app that searches for songs using the Spotify API. The code is uncomplete and it is the aim of the programmer that clones this repository to complete the code as he/she wants to understand the structure of the application.

<p>Gekko is a stock exchange simulator that allows you to buy and sell stock options. It is a experimental C application to try and use Hexagonal Architecture in a non object oriented language. There are three main parts in this application:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dozer: the client that connects to Gekko and allows users to buy and sell stock and check the IBEX values.</li>
<li>Gekko: the main server of the application which controls all the stock exchange actions.</li>
<li>TumblingDice: the server which provides all the IBEX updates to Gekko.

<a id="ranz" class="anchor" href="#ranz" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RAnz</h1>

<p>RAnz is a .nmea GPS file processor for riders developed in java. RAnz processes .nmea GPS files and extracts statistics from that information such as best time, best lap, distance, etc. at the same time that shows you the trace of your route. It is the best way of keeping track of your trainings and see how much you are improving. All information will be stored in a MySQL database so do not worry about losing it!

<p>K-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. In this technical report I will present a new approach to this algorithm for two dimensional spaces, with the possibility to evolve the algorithm to 3D and so on dimensions.

<p>Sorting Algorithms is a cpp self-made libary that includes the Quick, Merge, Insertion and Introspective sorting algorithms well commented and easy to understand for university students or anyone who wants to learn about sorting algorithms.</p>

<p>There is included a testDrive file that demostrates which of the algorithms is the most efficient. Take a look and see it by yourself!
